      <section>
         Summarize the conference.  Was in SF, talked about Javascript...
      </section>

      <section>
         Javascript is exciting, a lot of new ideas being brought to the platform
         and potentially revolutionizing things...
         <br /><br />
         Due to the great amount of legacy browsers, these can't make it to
         primetime, yet
      </section>

      <section>
         Like ECMA 6, which is bringing a lot of popular concepts to the languages,
         but when with that have full support across browsers?
      </section>

      <section>
         Or something like web components, a technology that wants to tear down the
         wall between HTML and JS.
         <br /><br />
         But it does have a polyfill library (in alpha).  Sadly it is giant,
         clocking in over 150 KB
      </section>

      <section>
         But I want to talk about web components anyways
      </section>

      <section>
         Imagine a world... where you can just import a library... and use new
         elements.
      </section>

      <section>
         or just drop HTML elements in that are really full bodied widgets
      </section>

      <section>
         or even give these elements children that can be interpreted (think like
         the <code>select</code>+<code>option</code> paradigm)
      </section>

      <section>
         (give a few seconds for people to recover)...
      </section>

      <section>
         now the how, oddly browsers already do it.  Think things like the new
         'video' tag or 'email' input boxes.  Now they want to provide this power to
         web developers.
      </section>

      <section>
         The bread and butter is the "Shadow DOM".  It is a sort of personal DOM
         paradise for your widget to live inside of.  Like your own personal iframe,
         but without being an iframe... and done in a safer way.
      </section>

      <section>
         It gives you your own DOM, so smaller model size, no id or class conflicts.
         This means you can have your own CSS without crazy selector chains to
         isolate the styles.  And your own JS namespace, so you can mess with the
         global namespace all you want.  And your own element API.  Calls to the
         wrapped HTML element you are inside such as `valueOf` can be controlled.
         <br /><br />
         For all intents and purposes, the parent application just sees it as
         another HTML element.
