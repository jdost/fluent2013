## Fast Design Decision-Making -- *Julie Horvath*

### A website's design should start where it's going to live

* Prototype in HTML+CSS
* Fonts render the same, same restrictions on pixels and positions

### Build

* Don't fear the blank canvas
* Start simple, to find the right direction (paper)
* Use a foundation, you don't have to start from scratch (bootstrap)

### CSS "Frameworks"

* Probably a lot of stuff you don't *need*
* Pick and choose what you will use/need
* Use the framework as a foundation
* Will eventually ripe out what you aren't using 
  ([CSSLint](https://github.com/stubbornella/csslint))

### Grids 

* Can be useless
* Help content hierarchy
* [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/), [960.gs](http://960.gs/),
  [skeleton](http://www.getskeleton.com/), [foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/)
* Media queries

### Pattern Libraries 

* Easy way to write markup
* Pears (site for common patterns of markup and style)
* Visual patterns are a trained eye (train for it, no magic potion)
* [Dribbble](http://dribbble.com/) & Buckets (collections of examples)

### Style Guides

* Not just color palettes
* Guidelines on both languages and look
