## More than Good Design -- *Sarah Mei*

* Good code is at the intersection of software design and team dynamics
* Not all dependencies are created equal
* Good code is defined by its pattern of dependencies

### Good Code

* OO Design principles
  * Practical Object Oriented Design in Ruby
* Development Practices
  * "Small A agile" - Pick some: TDD, meet clients, user stories, etc
* Good teams (?)
  > The aspects of things that are most important to us are hidden because of their 
  >  simplicity and familiarity

### Predictors

* Technical qualifications
* Experience with the code base
* Communication among team members
   * Communication patterns are the best predictor of code quality

### Decoding Smelly Code

* Knowledge Silos
* Developers ready for more nuance

> Pair Programming - turns the act of coding a process of communication

### Fixing Problems

* Create opportunities for informal communication
