# (Semi-)Automated Javascript Refactoring
## Giles Bowkett

* Refactoring is tedious and repetitive
* Robots should do tedious and repetitive work
* Specs & Tests add safety net for refactoring
* Track usage of functions/methods, mark differences in use
* Need a broken pattern to fix (not design pattern, text pattern)
* Filer scripts: open, scan regex (text streams)

[Towelie](https://github.com/gilesbowkett/towelie)

* Automated similarity detection
* Aims to keep things DRY

[Wheatley](https://github.com/gilesbowkett/wheatley)

* Targets JS
* Improves on Towelie, runs faster, targetted ruby versus JS

[Rewind](https://github.com/gilesbowkett/rewind)

* Git repo history analysis
* Use to target files often editted (possible hot zones)
