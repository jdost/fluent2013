# Javascript API Design

### 3 Ideas

* APIs are "Developer UX"
* API Design is a universal practice
* API Design is a "principle-drive" art form

### Judge Designs

* elegant, beautiful, utilitarian, simple
* ... or not

### Poor Design is Costly

* We apply design practices to UI (i.e. UX design)

### API Design?

* API Design is not JUST for Library Authors
* Modular JS is written to be consumed
* ... irrelevant of the number of consumers

We should not expect users to read the entire docs (RTFM - not acceptable answer in 
industrial design)

> If you want your users to RTFM, write a better FM

### Goals of API Design

* "Design the 'pit of success'"
* Should be intuitive and easy to stumble into
* Be Self-Describing
* Prevent Errors
* Make Users Fast

### Principles of API Design

* Ex: modernizr, moment.js, backbone
* WARNING: Art, not Science
* Unity & Harmony
   * Use similar and/or unify elements through your library to create familiarity 
     and comfort
   * Sane defaults (shouldn't need anything to get something on the page?)
* Balance
* Proportion
   * Scope that matches capability
   * Make sure that every interface of the library matches its intended purpose & 
     that no extraneous elements exist
   * Concise and simple (small libraries, focus)
* Emphasis
   * Creating a focal point
   * Provide a gateway method that anchors your library, a chained or fluent API, or 
     create extensibility hooks for consuming devs
   * Things should be easily extensible

### Things that go wrong

* Inconsistency
   * jQuery's $.each and $.map have reversed arguments for the function
` $.each(some, function (index, val) { ` vs. ` $.map(some, function (val, index) { `
   * Too many overloads (`jQuery()`) -- Wrap, Select, Clone, Empty, Create, Bind
   * Building and evolving an API is hard
* Disproportional
