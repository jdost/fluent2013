### Lie: "Browser Versions (still) Matter"

* Doesn't matter, browsers constantly update
* Versions are arbitrary marketing labels
* Features are what matter (use feature detection)
* [Modernizr][http://modernizr.com/]
* "Browser detection: it's like asking what house you live in to find the bathroom"
* Primary culprit is: analytics

### Lie: "Browsers should all be the same"

* Browsers are different **on purpose**
* Support all browsers exactly the same (don't need to)
* No one is going to go somewhere else because the button looks different
* Web is not a pixel perfect medium

### IE6 Sucks

* We blame the browser for our problems
* The enemy of the future is obsessing about the past
* Most users don't know what a browser is, let alone why each is better

### Users Suck

* Blocking and "abusing" users due to having the wrong browser version

### It just takes time and effort to make it work

* One browser engineer's bug is another web dev's hack

### Embrace

* Browser differences
* Feature detection
* "Supports _______"
* User choice
* "Oh well" degradation
* Regressive fallbacks
* Progressive enhancement
* "Reactive" design
