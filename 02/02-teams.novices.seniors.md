### You **need** junior developers

* Trained developers (via bootcamp) had 83% (20/24) retention @ livingsocial
* Hiring is a problem for employers (good for developers)
* Functional diversity (diverse ideas and backgrounds) i.e. different angles
* "When we are different, we think different"
* Diverse (random) groups of problem solvers outperform similar experts
* The language can be taught (the perspectives remain)
* Autonomy - "Let individuals control their own destiny" (give them something to own)
* Mastery - "Incentivize by challenge" (in over their head forces them to learn)
* Purpose - "make it meaningful"

### Your team **should** be novice ready

* Like the new team member (work better and help)
* Social proof, lead by example
* Authority - leaders need to be vocal about junior developers
* Banish skepticism
* Each novice needs a (technical) mentor to meet with regularly
* When starting something new, take **nothing** for granted
* Should have regular pairing sessions, with more than one person
* Code should be systematically reviews
* Developers should create individual learning goals with self chosen objectives


# Tips for a Senior Developer
## Carina Zona

* Fight for what you believe, but gracefully accept defeat
* Only true authority stems from knowledge not position, Help people level up
* Critique code, not people, give real assignments not just grunt work
* Don't be the coder in the corner (ninja, rockstar), hire on character, not just 
  skills "relentless focus on getting shit done"
* Accept that mistakes happen
* Treat people who know less with respect and patience
* Mentor
* I will focus on solving core problems (solutions, not problems)
* You are not your code (be open to criticism)
* No matter how much you know, someone knows more
* Don't rewrite code without consultation
* You don't need credit, it is not what is important
* Change happens, be fine with it
